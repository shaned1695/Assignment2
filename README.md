DT 228/2 Assignment 2. This is just a basic game

How to play the game.
To play the game, you will need to click on the screen, then use the left and right arrows on your keyboard to control the rectangle at the bottom of the screen. Press SPACE to start again.

The objective of the game is to dodge the balls for as long as possible. If one of the balls do hit you, the game will freeze and "GAME OVER" will be displayed on the screen. Due to a bug, this will not be the end of the game.

If you press space it was meant to reset the score and the speed. Unfortunatly, I couldn't get the millis to reset, so I chose not to reset the speed of the game. This means that you will just continue the game.
